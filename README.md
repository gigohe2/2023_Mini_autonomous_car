# 2023_Mini_autonomous_car

This repository is the result of a project to build small autonomous RC cars and validate autonomous driving algorithms.

I coducted SW development. 

## S/W
- Confirmation of small autonomous smart car operation and ROS integration
- Development of lateral path following algorithm using GPS location information and simulator verification
- Development of AI-based lane recognition algorithm and simulator verification
- Developed and verified AI-based ACC (adaptive cruise control) algorithm
- Developed a real-time autonomous smart car monitoring program
